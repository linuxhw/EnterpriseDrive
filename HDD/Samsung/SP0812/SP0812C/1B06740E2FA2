Powered_Up_Time is measured from power on, and printed as
DDd+hh:mm:SS.sss where DD=days, hh=hours, mm=minutes,
SS=sec, and sss=millisec. It "wraps" after 49.710 days.

Error 1699 occurred at disk power-on lifetime: 26848 hours (1118 days + 16 hours)
  When the command that caused the error occurred, the device was active or idle.
