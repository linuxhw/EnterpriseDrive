KIOXIA NVMe Drives
==================

This is a list of all tested KIOXIA NVMe drive models and their MTBFs. See more
info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/EnterpriseDrive).

NVME by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days — avg. days per sample,
Err  — avg. errors per sample,
MTBF — avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF |
|-----------|--------------------|--------|---------|-------|-------|------|
| KIOXIA    | KCD6XLUL1T92       | 1.9 TB | 10      | 109   | 0     | 0.30   |
| KIOXIA    | KCD61LUL3T84       | 3.8 TB | 20      | 5     | 0     | 0.01   |
