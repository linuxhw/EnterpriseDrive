ADATA NVMe Drives
=================

This is a list of all tested ADATA NVMe drive models and their MTBFs. See more
info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/EnterpriseDrive).

NVME by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days - avg. days per sample,
Err  - avg. errors per sample,
MTBF - avg. MTBF in years per sample.
