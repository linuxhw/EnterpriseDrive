AMD Solid State Drives
======================

This is a list of all tested AMD solid state drive models and their MTBFs. See
more info on reliability test in the [README](https://github.com/linuxhw/EnterpriseDrive).

SSD by Model
------------

Please take all columns into account when reading the table. Pay attention on the
number of tested samples and power-on days. Simultaneous high values of both MTBF
and errors are possible if only rare drives in the subset encounter errors.

Days - avg. days per sample,
Err  - avg. errors per sample,
MTBF - avg. MTBF in years per sample.

| MFG       | Model              | Size   | Samples | Days  | Err   | MTBF |

| AMD       | R5SL120G           | 120 GB | 2       | 282   | 0     | 0.78   |
